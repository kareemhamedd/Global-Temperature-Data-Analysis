### 🌍 Global Temperature Data Analysis

This project explores over a century of global land temperature data to uncover patterns and insights related to climate change. Using the **GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry** dataset from Kaggle, the analysis investigates how average temperatures have changed from 1900 to 2013 across different countries and regions.

### 🔍 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess real-world climate data using **Pandas**.
* Visualize temperature trends over time with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
* Identify the **top 10 hottest countries** on average.
* Compare temperature trends among selected countries (e.g., Egypt, USA, India, Canada, Australia).
* Highlight global warming patterns and regional differences.

### 🧠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3.13**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and reporting

### 📊 Key Insights

* A clear upward trend in global land temperatures since the early 20th century.
* Noticeable regional variations — tropical countries show consistently higher averages.
* Developed an automated visualization pipeline that generates and saves analytical charts.
